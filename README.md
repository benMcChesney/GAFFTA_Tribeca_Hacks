The concept : 
Using humans ( people ) to curate a subset of videos that share common movement characteristics.

This application loads all videos and and plays directional videos in a sequence. 

Each video's file name has it's characteristics.

uniqueName = surfingVideo
Horizontal / Vertical movement( H or V )  = H
Direction of Movement ( North or East or South or West ) = N

which combined becomes

"uniqueName_H_E.mov"
